Create a mapper.py file that implements the mapper logic. It will read the data from STDIN and will split the lines
into words, and will generate an output of each word with its individual count.
Hadoop Streaming is a feature that comes with Hadoop and allows users or developers to use various different languages
for writing MapReduce programs like Python, C++, Ruby, etc. It supports all the languages that can read from standard

We will implement the word count problem in python to understand Hadoop Streaming. We will be creating mapper.py and
reducer.py to perform map and reduce tasks.
